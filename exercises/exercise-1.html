<h2> Who? </h2>

<p> Brayden Woo is currently a student at UMass Amherst, studying English, and hoping to pursue a career in editing/publishing. His hobbies include reading, practicing piano, and trying to learn to draw.</p>

<h2> More Info </h2>

<p> Born in Framingham (probably), Brayden has spent most all his life living in Natick, Massachusetts, and completed his primary schooling there at Natick Highschool in 2022. An avid reader throughout those years, Brayden focused on reading-centric activities, and notably did not join any coding or robotics clubs, instead electing to focus on consuming as much fun/interesting content as possible. This was of debatable productivity. </p>

<p> Now in his senior year of college, Brayden is trying to be a little more proactive concerning his supposed professional future, and so has enrolled in a course to help him be more tech-literate, a skill that will certainly be useful probably everywhere. </p>

<p> Outside of classwork, Brayden has taken up several creative hobbies, to which he does his best to ration out it time to. He recognizes that, for an English major, he reads awfully little, and hopes that he will have more time for books once he graduates, whether or not that is realistic. He enjoys most all fictional genres.</p>

<p> Brayden has also taken two creative writing courses at UMass—and is currently starting a third—and has produced a few short stories/flash fiction pieces which he is generally happy with. You may see some on appear on this site as it is updated.</p>
